Hey there! I'm Ali. I'm obsessed with technology, organizatrional change, and innovation as tools that can turn ambitious ideas into impact. I've wrangled cloud platforms, containerization, automation, and data analytics projects. Think of me as a friendly tech whisperer who speaks both code and C-Suite fluently.

I've been called a “cloud architect” (which sounds way cooler than it is), but basically, I help companies build smarter, faster, and more scalable systems using tools like AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, OpenShift, and a bunch of other open source tech.

I love open-source tech, mostly because it’s awesome, but also because it makes me sound like a rebel. I’ve led multi-million dollar projects, grown contracts by 15% or more, and built innovation labs that help companies do cool stuff way faster.

When I'm not busy geeking out over the latest tech trends or convincing executives why they need the next big thing, you can find me enjoying a good coffee or overanalyzing the latest sci-fi movie.

Let's connect if you want to talk cloud, AI, automation, or just share tech horror stories.
